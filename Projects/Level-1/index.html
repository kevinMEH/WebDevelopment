  Reflection:
  Overall, I thought that this project pretty easy. I've 
  worked with HTML and have already mastered most JS 
  concepts and I was almost done after 2 class periods. 
  I still did face a few challenges though, for example 
  the styling of some elements of the page. I didn't know 
  how to center a div and I had to look it up, and even 
  when I made the style the same as Stackoverflow says, 
  it was still not centered. I realized that it was 
  because I forgot to put an equal sign after "style". 
  I'll definitely be more careful next time.
